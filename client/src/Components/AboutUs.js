                            We envision a world where girls in East Africa live healthy, safe, educated lives while defining <br /> their own purpose-a world in which menstrual health management is recognized as a human right,<br /> and the onset of puberty as the most effective time to engage girls and boys in a range of personal <br /> health decisions.
                        </p>

                                There is no magic bullet solution to girlsâ€™ education, safety, and empowerment. These are complex <br /> issues requiring complex, holistic solutions.

                                NiaAfrica addresses these challenges <strong>by equipping adolescent girls in Kenya with the tools <br /> they need to safely navigate puberty and unlock their potential.</strong>

                                <p>It is only when girls have the education they seek about their bodies and rights,<br /> along with the quality products and resources they need to stay healthy and safe, <br />that they can make informed decisions about their lives. Access to these resources <br />among boys, adults, and the larger communities in which girls live is essential<br /> for sustainability and long term impact.</p>
