### Description
A web application meant to help girls in most sub-saharan countries access pads and other supplies needed for their periods by bringing onboard both donors and charities who are willing to take part in this important cause. Donors get a chance to go through the various profiles of charities listed in the platform and make their donations to a charity of their choice. Equally, new charities get a chance to register on the platform once approved by the admin.
